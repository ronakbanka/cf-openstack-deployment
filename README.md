Openstack Deploymnet
=======================
The way to a working Openstack deployment with CloudFoundry

Preinstallation
====
Preinstallation setup routine:
````bash
sudo apt-get install mercurial
sudo apt-get install bzr

bash < <(curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moovweb/gvm/master/binscripts/gvm-installer)
source /home/ubuntu/.gvm/scripts/gvm

gvm install go1.2
gvm use go1.1.2
mkdir ~/go
export GOPATH=~/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
go get github.com/vito/spiff
````

Merging the files above:
````bash
spiff merge cf-deployment.yml cf-jobs.yml cf-networks.yml cf-properties.yml cf-settings.yml > deployment.yml 
````

Running deployment:
````bash
bosh deployment deployment.yml
bosh deploy
````

Debugging with SSH
===
Connection to a bosh instance for debugging via SSH. This can be done like this:

````bash
ubuntu@micro-bosh:~$ bosh ssh
1. nats_z1/0
2. postgres_z1/0
3. uaa_z1/0
4. login_z1/0
5. runner_z1/0
6. loggregator_z1/0
7. loggregator_trafficcontroller_z1/0
8. router_z1/0
Choose an instance: 8
Enter password (use it to sudo on remote host): **********
Target deployment is `cf-cs'

Setting up ssh artifacts
Please specify a public key file
````

In some cases, mostly on newly setup Ubuntus you will recieve the error above `Please specify a public key file` which can be easily solved via:

````bash
ubuntu@micro-bosh:~$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
f0:0c:84:4e:c6:a6:3c:7a:35:c5:92:f9:47:f9:94:4b ubuntu@micro-bosh
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+
|   . =.  . .     |
|    X.o o E      |
| . * +o. + .     |
|  + + .=. o      |
| . o . .S        |
|. .              |
| .               |
|                 |
|                 |
+-----------------+
````

Afterwards you should be able to connect to the instance without any issue.
````bash
ubuntu@micro-bosh:~$ bosh ssh
1. nats_z1/0

...

8. router_z1/0
Choose an instance: 8
Enter password (use it to sudo on remote host): **********
